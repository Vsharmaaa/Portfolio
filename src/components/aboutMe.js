        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a budding software developer, honing my skills at Seneca College.
          My journey is fueled by a blend of technological prowess and a jovial spirit that brings a 
          refreshing energy to my work and collaborations.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an aspiring full-stack developer, Iâ€™m well-versed in the latest technologies and driven 
          by the challenge of transforming complex problems into elegant solutions. My interests span 
          playing chess, which sharpens my strategic thinking, exploring the harmonious world of music,
          and cheering on cricket matches, celebrating every victory as if it were my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to leverage this vibrant mix of interests and expertise to become an innovative 
          professional who contributes to exciting projects, learns continuously, and shares my zest 
          for life with my peers in the tech industry.
